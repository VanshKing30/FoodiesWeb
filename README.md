# Quick Start for Contributors 🚀 <a name="quickstart"></a>

## To get started with contributing to the FoodiesWeb project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/FoodiesWeb
   ```
2. **Split Terminal for Backend Setup**

3. **Navigate to the Server Directory:**
   ```bash
    cd path/to/FoodiesWeb/server
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies (in both terminals):**
   ```bash
     npm install
   ```
5. **Start the Backend Server (in the terminal within the /server directory):** <br>
   In the terminal where you navigated to the /server directory, run the following command to start the backend server:
   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```
6. **Navigate to the src (with Backend Running):**<br>
   In the other terminal, run the following command to navigate to the src folder (frontend):
   ```bash
   cd src
   ```
7. **Start the React App (with Backend Running):**<br>
   After navigating run the following command to start the React app with the backend server running successfully:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   With these steps, you'll have both the backend server and the React app up and running, ready for development or testing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
