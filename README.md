## Introduction

Hey there, fellow foodies! We are the API Alchemists, and we're thrilled to introduce you to "Foodies," our web app created for the BITSxPostman API hackathon. Foodies is designed to enhance your college food adventures, making them more convenient and fun.

## What Does Foodies Do?

Imagine being a college student at lunchtime, wanting a delicious meal but unsure about the menu at each canteen on campus. That's where Foodies comes in. It serves as your personal food oracle, allowing you to check daily menus for all campus canteens right from your devices.

### Nutritional Information at Your Fingertips

Foodies isn't just about showing menus; it's also your health-conscious best friend. It uses the Spoonacular API to provide nutritional information for all dishes, empowering you to make informed and healthy choices.

### Empowering Canteen Owners

Foodies benefits not only students but also canteen owners. It helps them plan menus, suggests recipes, and streamlines canteen operations.

### User-Friendly Experience

We prioritize security and user-friendliness. Students can easily sign up, and canteen owners receive secure login credentials from the college.

### Health News

The health news section delivers articles from the G News API, offering insights into good dietary choices and empowering users with knowledge for healthier eating.

## Tech Stack

Foodies is built using cutting-edge technologies:

- React.js: For a fantastic and smooth web app experience.
- Tailwind CSS: For stylish and user-friendly design.
- Express.js: Powering the backend engine.
- MongoDB Atlas: Storing essential data securely.

- Spoonacular API: Providing nutritional information and recipe ideas.
